    "repo_context": "PAS (Price Adjustment System) defines a system for managing price adjustments, leveraging technologies like Spring Boot, GraphQL, BigTable, and Dataflow. Core Functionalities of the PAS are as below. Price Adjustment Management - CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for price adjustment sets and adjustments. Data Storage - Uses PostgreSQL for storing adjustment sets and adjustments, and BigTable for storing adjustment data and metadata. Data Processing - Leverages Dataflow pipelines for loading, deleting, and updating adjustments in BigTable based on data from BigQuery. Granularity and Priority - Defines various granularity types (e.g., OCID_BCLG, SKU_BCLG) and priority levels to determine which adjustment applies based on specific criteria. GraphQL API - Provides a GraphQL interface to query price adjustments based on various criteria (e.g., OCID, BCLG ID, SKU, timestamp, labels).",
